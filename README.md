# Veoneer Photo Challenge 2019
Have you ever wondered how amazing it would be, if you could have your favorite photo being painted by your favorite artist? In this notebook we would like to re-paint a milestone moment of Veoneer (**2 July 2018 when Veoneer was listed on New York Stock Exchange**, fig. 1) as if **Picasso**, Van Gogh, Wassily Kandinsky, Natasha Wescoat, Leonoid Afremov, etc would have drawn it.



The idea comes from the paper "Image style transfer using convolutional neural networks" by LA Gatys, AS Ecker, M Bethge.
